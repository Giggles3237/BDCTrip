# Interactive Voting System Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the interactive voting system for the Baltimore/DC trip website. The system allows 7 participants to vote on their preferred attractions in each category (dining, shopping, casinos) and visualizes the voting results using charts.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. `./final/js/voting.js` - Implements the voting system logic
2. `./final/js/charts.js` - Implements the results visualization

### Modified Files:
1. `./final/index.html` - Updated to include the new JavaScript files and voting section
2. `./final/css/style.css` - Added styles for the voting system components
3. `./final/js/content.js` - Modified to make attractions data available to the voting system

## Implementation Details

### Voting System (`voting.js`)
- **User Identification**: Simple participant selection system for 7 participants
- **Voting Limits**: 
  - Dining: 3 votes per participant
  - Shopping: 2 votes per participant
  - Casino: 1 vote per participant
- **Vote Storage**: Uses localStorage to persist votes between sessions
- **Vote Management**: Functions to add, update, and remove votes
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents participants from voting multiple times for the same attraction
- **User Feedback**: Displays which attractions each participant has voted for

### Results Visualization (`charts.js`)
- **Chart Library**: Uses Chart.js (loaded from CDN)
- **Chart Types**:
  - Bar chart for dining votes
  - Pie chart for shopping votes
  - Doughnut chart for casino votes
- **Data Display**: Shows the number of votes each attraction has received
- **Percentage Calculation**: Includes percentage calculations in tooltips
- **Visual Design**: Charts match the website's design aesthetic

### Integration with Existing Website
- **HTML Structure**: Added voting section with participant selection and results display
- **CSS Styling**: Added styles for voting buttons, participant selection, and charts
- **Data Connection**: Connected the voting system with the existing content display system

### Mobile Responsiveness
- **Responsive Design**: All voting components adapt to different screen sizes
- **Mobile-Friendly Charts**: Charts resize based on container width
- **Touch-Friendly Controls**: Buttons sized appropriately for touch interaction
